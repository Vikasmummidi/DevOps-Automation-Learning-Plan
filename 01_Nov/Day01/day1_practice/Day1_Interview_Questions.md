1. How do you list all environment variables in Linux?
2. What’s the difference between `export VAR=value` and `VAR=value`?
3. Where would you define environment variables permanently?

**Tip:** Most interviewers check if you truly understand how Linux environments behave under automation tools — so always relate answers to CI/CD, Docker, or AWS workflows.
